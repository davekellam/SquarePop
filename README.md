Before it shut down, the popular posts list at del.icio.us was one of my regular internet visits. In early 2009, I wrote some scripts to grab to grab the RSS feed every hour, and then collate those feeds daily into one digest page. I've included those scripts. They ran on a shared Dreamhost account, and probably could have been a lot more robust.

I've also included a CSV and SQL dump of the database, someone may find the data useful. I do have all of the original RSS feed scrapes as well (but it's >600k files at close to 500mb). I can upload them if someone is really interested.
